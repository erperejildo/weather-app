# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## RUN

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can also check the app here: https://main--weather-dani.netlify.app

## TEST

```
npm run test
```

components from Shadcn.: DONE
asking for credit card when creating account so I used https://weather.visualcrossing.com instead

- This API doesn't proved for example min and max temp so I used something else to be displayed
- I can't tell from design what do we want to do with the header while scrolling apart from making it smaller, so I used a background for this
- For further explanations search for "NOTE:"
