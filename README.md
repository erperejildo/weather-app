## NOTES

- Original API was asking for credit card when creating account so I used https://weather.visualcrossing.com instead
- This API didn't provide for example min and max temp so I used something else to be displayed
- I can't tell from design what do we want to do with the header while scrolling apart from making it smaller, so I used a background for this to improve UX
- For further explanations search for "NOTE:"
